I am a dedicated, self-motivated software developer currently studying at <a href="https://makers.tech/hire/">Makers Academy</a>, having transitioned into technology after recently qualifying as a solicitor. My background in law has equipped me with a passion for problem-solving and strong communication and analytical skills. Unlike the law, a career as a developer fulfils my desire to work on projects that I am genuinely passionate about, in an environment where the culture and values closely align with my own.

For me, software development is the perfect blend of technology and creativity, giving me the opportunity to combine the two to create exciting projects from start to finish. I took the leap into software development as it encompasses all that I am passionate about: collaborating with motivated and likeminded people; constantly learning new things; and using technology to connect and share the world.

I am looking for an entry-level developer role in a supportive environment where I can continue to learn and become the best developer I can be.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communicator  

- Training as a solicitor equipped me with excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. I was required to communicate confidently and coherently on a daily basis, whether that be via written word, over the telephone or in face-to-face meetings. I recognise the importance of great communication in order to build relationships, work effectively together and deliver great results. My written communication is also well-developed, as I was required to write to clients and draft documentation on a daily basis, translating technical legal jargon into non-technical language.

- During my time at Makers Academy, I maintained a <a href="www.codingfoodie.co.uk">blog</a> about my journey from law into software development and documenting my experiences along the way.

#### Attention to Detail

- Being meticulous with careful attention to detail is a skill that I have developed through my legal training, as it is important that information is communicated correctly and that documents are carefully checked for errors. This skill has proved to be invaluable when it comes to scanning and checking code that I have written or that a pair partner has written.

#### Adaptable and Quick to Learn

- I was often thrown in at the deep end whilst training as a solicitor: attending court last minute; drafting documents to tight deadlines; and researching niche points of law quickly in order to report back to a waiting client. I was able to adapt to the situations I was presented with and pick up a variety of knowledge in order to ensure I was well-informed and best prepared to represent a client.

- Studying at Makers Academy required adapting to a new style of learning and taking on board a lot of information and techniques at a very fast pace. I have quickly picked up  new technical skills, learnt new languages and frameworks and also methods of working.

#### Analytical Mindset

- My legal education taught me to approach problems with an analytical mind as I had to understand and untangle complex legal problems, analyse and research the multiple elements to them, and come up with effective solutions for  clients.

- Whilst at Makers Academy, I approached problems in a methodical and analytical way, following an effective debugging process and breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable chunks to meet specifications and find a solution.
